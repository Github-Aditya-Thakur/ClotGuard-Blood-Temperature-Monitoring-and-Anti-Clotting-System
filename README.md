## I. Introduction

Blood is a critical resource in medical care; however, traditional systems face significant challenges, including inconsistent storage, tracking inefficiencies, and transportation delays, resulting in frequent wastage and potential life-threatening situations.

ClotGuard aims to solve these problems using advanced technologies:
- IoT sensors for real-time monitoring of blood temperature, humidity, and movement.
- Blockchain for secure, tamper-proof transaction tracking.
- GPS and geofencing for efficient logistics and safe transportation.
- AI algorithms and donor-patient matching for streamlined emergency response.
